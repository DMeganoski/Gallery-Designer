This application is intended to cover a variety of uses, specifically targeted at small businesses who want to 'show things off', though it can also serve as, say, a family photo album. There is alot that you can do with this.

There are a few key files that you should know about, as they are used multiple times and you may want to make some changes to them.

The helper files found in /galleries/views/helper
	itemdisplay.php is the file that will display certain images in a gallery fashion.
		itemdisplay.php includes the other file,
	pager.php. This is the file that contains the html and php for the page buttons at the bottom of the gallery pages.

Each item in the gallery can have a variety of properties.
