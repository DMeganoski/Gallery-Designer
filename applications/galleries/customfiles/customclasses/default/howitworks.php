        <h1>Design Your Own Tin!</h1>
      <h2>Designing your own tin is easy</h2>
	  <p>Unfortunately, the interactive tin designer is not yet ready for public release.</br>
		  Tin orders can still be completed as they have been in the past, though.</p>
	  <p>Even after the interactive designer has been implemented, you can use the traditional methods if you prefer!
	  </p>
	  <p>The following describes our process of completing orders. The brown areas are steps in the classic process,
		  the blue areas pertain to using the tin designer.

            <div class="ListWrapper">

				<h2 class="Step">1. Choose a Size and Color Tin</h2>
				<ul class="HowTo">
					<li class="Special Classic">Until the designer is implemented, this means remembering
					the code numbers of products and placing an order via the phone or email</li>
					<li class="Special Future">Once the designer is implemented, this will mean simply
					clicking a button on this site to add that product to your order.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="ListWrapper">
				<h2 class="Step">2. Create your cover</h2>
				<ul class="HowTo">
				<li class="Special Classic">The traditional method of design is to download a template and have
				your graphics department design one. We also offer custom design by our own staff
				at an additional cost.</li>
				<li class="Special Future">With the new tin designer, your selection of stock art background (optional)
					and uploaded images can be placed, adjusted, and customized just the way you want it.</li>
				<li>Tins Covers usually consist of three parts; A background, a logo, and a message. The
				only limitations are your creativity, though!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="ListWrapper">
				<h2 class="Step">3. Finalize your Order</h2>
				<ul class="HowTo">
					<li class="Special Classic">In the past, orders were placed over the phone or email, and a sample
						was created and delivered for inspection.</li>
					<li class="Special Future">With the tin designer, you will see the final product in real time, just enter the quantity
					you desire and click submit order.</li>
				<li>The covers are printed onto a very durable vinyl using a professional-grade printer, and
				placed onto the tins.</li>
				<li>For small and simple orders placed before 12 P.M. EST, the order will ship the same day!</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

            <div class="ListWrapper">
				<h2 class="Step">4. Go further</h2>
				<ul class="HowTo">
				<li>Empty tin not enough for you?<br/>
					Want special packaging or to have the tins filled with yummy snacks?</li>
				<li>Special orders are no problem! <a href="/gallery/default/contactus">Contact Us</a> today and we'll
