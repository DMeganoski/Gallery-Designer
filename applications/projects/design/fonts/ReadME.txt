+mw.eVo.Kiddie's DESIGN FONT PACK #3
--------------------------------
Thanks for downloading my third font pack! Here are, once again, 25 nice, handpicked fonts from me. Take note that I didn't make any of them, I just collected + packed them. Recently I've been in an electronica-space font groove so don't mind the plenty of spacey/tech fonts XD

So, enjoy!
